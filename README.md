# Â¡Hola!

## Welcome to my profile!

I'm **Daniel**, a Business Intelligence student from Monterrey, Mexico interested in learning and applying data science in all kinds of ways. I am currently learning *R* and *Python* for data manipulation and visualization, and I know basic *C++* as well.

I would like to someday build ML and DL models. As I expand my skills, I plan to publish repositories for all of my personal projects.
