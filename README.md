## Hello!

I'm **Daniel**, a Business Intelligence student from Monterrey, Mexico interested in learning and applying data science in all kinds of ways. I am currently learning *R* and *Python* for data manipulation and visualization, but I know basic C++ as well.

As I expand my skills, I plan to publish repositories for all of my personal projects.
